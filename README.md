# firefly-runtime

The beating heart of [Firefly Zero](https://fireflyzero.com/). The runtime that runs the given app: executes wasm binaries, provides host functions, manages state, etc.

The runtime is sandwiched between the entry point ([firefly-emulator](https://github.com/firefly-zero/firefly-emulator) or [firefly-main](https://github.com/firefly-zero/firefly-main)) and [firefly-hal](https://github.com/firefly-zero/firefly-hal).

See [Firefly Zero docs](https://docs.fireflyzero.com/user/installation/) to get started.
